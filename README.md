# Gift Recommendation API üéÅ

A smart gift recommendation engine that uses OpenAI's AI capabilities combined with Amazon's product catalog to suggest perfect gifts based on personalized criteria.

## Features ‚ú®

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Uses OpenAI to understand nuanced preferences and suggest thoughtful gifts
- **Amazon Integration**: Recommends real, purchasable products from Amazon
- **Personalized Criteria**: Considers:
  - Relationship to recipient (partner, friend, colleague, etc.)
  - Budget range
  - Recipient's interests and preferences
  - Occasion (birthday, anniversary, holiday, etc.)
- **Simple API Interface**: Easy-to-use endpoints for integration with your applications

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. User provides details about:
   - Who they're shopping for
   - Their relationship
   - Budget
   - Interests/preferences
   - Occasion
2. The system uses OpenAI to analyze these inputs and generate gift ideas
3. The Amazon API is queried for real products matching these ideas
4. Curated recommendations are returned to the user
